NOTE:
jsni.h and jsni-convert.h are not in default header files that node-gyp will install and use.
So you must manually copy them to your header file path or node-gyp default header file path.

Like:
Your header file path: MYAPP/include/jsni.h
or:
Node-gyp header file path: ~/.node-gyp/4.4.0/include/node/
